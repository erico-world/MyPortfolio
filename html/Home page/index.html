                <h5>Designer, <span class="dev">Developer</span> & <span class="promo">Promoter</span></h5>
                <p class="long-short">
                    Hello there! My name is Eric, and I'm a passionate developer, designer, 
                    blogger, content creator, video/photo editor, programmer and much more. 
                    I've always been fascinated by technology and its endless possibilities, 
                    and I consider myself lucky to be able to turn this fascination into a fulfilling career.

                    I have been programming for over 2 years and during that time, 
                    I've gained a wealth of experience working on a variety of projects, 
                    from small-scale applications to complex enterprise solutions. 
                    My primary programming languages are python, javascript, react, java, and c 
                    but I'm always eager to learn new ones and expand my skill set.

                    My development philosophy is centered around building efficient, scalable, 
                    and user-friendly applications that solve real-world problems. 
                    I believe that the best software is the one that seamlessly integrates into 
                    people's lives, making their day-to-day tasks easier and more efficient.

                    Apart from coding, I'm also passionate about technology trends, 
                    and I'm always on the lookout for new and innovative ways to improve the 
                    software development process. I'm a big believer in the power of collaboration 
                    and team-work, and I thrive in a dynamic environment where new ideas are constantly 
                    being explored and tested.

                    In my free time, you'll usually find me tinkering with new technologies, 
                    reading up on industry news, or honing my coding skills. I'm also an avid gamer, 
                    and I enjoy playing online multiplayer games with my friends.

                    If you're looking for a skilled and passionate developer to work on your next project, 
                    then look no further! I'm always up for a new challenge, and I'd be thrilled to 
                    bring my expertise to your team.
